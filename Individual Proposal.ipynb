    "# Individual Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly influenced individuals’ mental health and social behaviors. The CSCS dataset provides a rich source of information on protection methods, mental conditions, loneliness, and family supports, offering an ideal research direction to analyze the relationships between them. This project aims to explore potential connections between protection, life satisfaction, and social interaction using three types of analysis to reveal important factors that affect people’s quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal begins by describing the variables and analytical methods chosen for the subsequent study. It then presents the anticipated results and discusses how these findings could support the project. If completed, initial results will also be included to provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUESTION 1: Is there any relationship between the support from family and friends and the frequency of social interaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**:\n",
    "- **Social Support**  \n",
    "  - Indicator: `PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_family_helps`\n",
    "- **Social Frequency**  \n",
    "  - Indicator: `CONNECTION_activities_talked_day_p3m`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis Test**: Conduct a two-sample t-test by dividing participants into high and low social support groups (> or < 3 months) and comparing the means in social frequency between these two groups.\n",
    "   - **H₀**: There is no significant relationship between support and frequency.\n",
    "   - **Hₐ**: There is a significant relationship between support and frequency.  \n",
    "   *(This method of hypothesis testing was studied in Lecture 5)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confidence Interval**: Build a 95% confidence interval to estimate the scale of the means in each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results**:\n",
    "- If the p-value from the test is less than 0.05 and the mean social frequency is significantly higher in the high-support group than in the low-support group, it suggests a positive relationship between social support and social frequency.\n",
    "- If there is no overlap between the two confidence intervals, it may indicate a significant difference between the two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**:\n",
    "The finding would suggest that family or friend support may encourage more frequent social interactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## QUESTION 2: During the pandemic, does loneliness impact physical health more than social frequency?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**:\n",
    "- **Loneliness**  \n",
    "  - Indicator: `LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score` to assess the level of loneliness experienced by an individual.\n",
    "- **Social Frequency**  \n",
    "  - Represented by `CONNECTION_activities_video_chat_p3m`.\n",
    "- **Physical Health**  \n",
    "  - Using `WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression Equation**: Set up a multiple linear regression model with physical health as the dependent variable, loneliness and social frequency as independent variables, to compare the impacts of both variables.  \n",
    "   *(This method has not yet been covered in the lectures, but I believe it is an effective approach for addressing this question)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bootstrapping**: Create multiple bootstrap samples from the raw data. Conduct regression analysis on each bootstrap sample to calculate regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results**:\n",
    "- It may show that the regression coefficient for loneliness is more significant than that for social frequency, suggesting that loneliness has a stronger impact on physical health during the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**:\n",
    "This analysis could help us understand the importance of mental factors in the pandemic, providing insight into how loneliness specifically impacts physical health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaboration Note\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to collaborate with **Bill Chen**. We are in the same tutorial and share similar interests. Working together would allow us to combine our ideas and create a more comprehensive analysis of the project.\n"
