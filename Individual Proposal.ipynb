    "# Individual Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly influenced individual’s mental health and social behaviours. The CSCS dataset has provided a rich source of information on the protection methods, the mental condition, the loneliness and family supports, offering an ideal research direction to analyse the relationships between them. This project aims to work out the potential connections between protection, life satisfaction and social interaction using three kinds of analysis, to reveal the important factors which can affect people’s life quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal begins by describing the variables and analytical methods chosen for the subsequent study. Next, it presents the anticipated results and discusses how these findings could support the project. Finally, if it has been completed, initial results will be included to provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUESTION 1: If there is any relationship between the support from family and friends and the frequency of social interaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social support**  \n",
    "  - Indicator: `PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_family_helps`\n",
    "- **Social frequency**  \n",
    "  - Indicator: `CONNECTION_activities_talked_day_p3m`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis test**: Conduct a two-sample t-test by dividing participants into high and low social support groups (> or < 3 months), compare the means in social frequency between these two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **H0**: There is no significant relationship between the support and the frequency.\n",
    "   - **Ha**: There is significant relationship between the support and the frequency.  \n",
    "   *(this method of hypothesis testing is studied from Lecture 5)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confidence Interval**: Build a CI to estimate the scale of the means of each group. Namely, calculate the 95% confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**:  \n",
    "   - **Boxplot**: Compare the differences of the means in the same boxplot.  \n",
    "   - **Confidence Interval Plot**: Suggest the 95% CI, which can intuitively judge whether the difference is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible results**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value calculated from the test is less than 0.05 and the mean social frequency is significantly higher in the high-support group than in the low-support group, it suggests a positive relationship between social support and social frequency.  \n",
    "If there is no overlap between the two confidence intervals, it can indicate that there is a significant difference between the two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The finding suggests that family or friend support may encourage more frequent social interactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## QUESTION 2: During the pandemic, does loneliness impact physical health more than social frequency?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loneliness**  \n",
    "  - Indicator: `LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score` to assess the level of loneliness experienced by an individual.\n",
    "- **Social frequency**  \n",
    "  - Represented by `CONNECTION_activities_video_chat_p3m`.\n",
    "- **Physical health**  \n",
    "  - Using `WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression Equation**: Set up a multiple linear regression model with physical health as the dependent variable, loneliness and social frequency as independent variables to compare the impacts of both variables.  \n",
    "   *(This method is not yet being taught in the Lecture, but I think it is a good way to solve the problem)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bootstrapping**: Taking samples from the raw data to create multiple Bootstrap samples. Then using regression analysis on each Bootstrap sample to calculate regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot**: Draw scatter plots between loneliness and social frequency and physical health separately to observe the distribution and trends of data points.  \n",
    "- **Regression Plot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible results**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It may show that the regression coefficient for loneliness is more significant than that for social frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: Can help us understand the importance of mental factor in the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaboration note\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to collaborate with **Bill Chen**. We are in the same tutorial and share the same interests with each other. Working together would allow us to combine our ideas and create a more comprehensive analysis of the project.\n"
